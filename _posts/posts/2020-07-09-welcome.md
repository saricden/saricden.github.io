Hello and welcome to the inaugural post of Internet Science, a web development blog written by yours truly, Kirk M (also known as @saricden). This blog is intended to be an information resource for various web technologies. Here you'll learn all sorts of things from front-end web development, to databases, and even app and game development.

I've wanted to start a blog for a long time, but was always distracted by other projects. Welp, I'm fresh out of new project ideas, so it's time to revist this good ol' one.

I feel like I've got more than a few tidbits of information that will prove useful to my fellow developers, so it's time to start sharing them.

Not sure what else to throw in this inital posting. We're here, we're sheer, get used to it world.

Stay tuned, we got big things in store! :)

Love Kirk M. (@saricden)
